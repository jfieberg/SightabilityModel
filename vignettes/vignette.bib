We performed univariate and stepwise logistic regression analyses. Moose sightability from helicopters was best predicted by measuring percent vegetation cover around each group observed during surveys where the probability of sighting moose groups was ${\rm e}^{u}/\ 1+{\rm e}^{u}$ with u = 5.044 - 1.772 (vegetation cover class: value from 1-6 representing 6 cover classes from 0-100% with 17.5% interval width). After percent vegetation cover was entered in the model, there were no effects from the 3 study areas though habitat types and topography varied substantially. Therefore, this model should be suitable for calculating correction factors for surveys throughout Wyoming and possibly over much of the species' range.},

Factors affecting visibility during helicopter surveys of bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) have not been quantified. We measured visibility bias for helicopter surveys of bighorn sheep in southwestern Idaho. Visibility was influenced (P < 0.05) by activity, habitat, sex composition of groups, light condition, position of sheep relative to the helicopter, and topographic position but not by group size (P = 0.781). Multivariate regression indicated that activity (P < 0.001) and habitat (P < 0.002) variables were the most important factors affecting visibility. A sightability model was developed to estimate bighorn population and composition parameters from data collected during helicopter surveys. We conducted 12 surveys in southwestern Idaho. The estimated population observed during helicopter surveys ranged from 51.7 to 78.1% and averaged 67.1% (CV = 10.6%). Confidence intervals for population estimates ranged from 16.4 to 22.9% and averaged 18.5% (CV = 16.0%) of the population estimate. We recommend correcting survey data for visibility bias to estimate bighorn sheep population parameters.},

     abstract = {Finite population sampling theory is useful in estimating total population size (abundance) from abundance estimates of each sampled unit (quadrat). We develop estimators that allow correlated quadrat abundance estimates, even for quadrats in different sampling strata. Correlated quadrat abundance estimates based on mark-recapture or distance sampling methods occur when data are pooled across quadrats to estimate, for example, capture probability parameters or sighting functions. When only minimal information is available from each quadrat, pooling of data across quadrats may be necessary to efficiently estimate capture probabilities or sighting functions. We further include information from a quadrat-based auxiliary variable to more precisely estimate total population size via a ratio estimator. We also provide variance estimators for the difference between or the ratio of 2 abundance estimates, taken at different times. We present an example based on estimating the number of Mexican spotted owls (Strix occidentalis lucida) in the Upper Gila Mountains Recovery Unit, Arizona and New Mexico, USA. Owl abundance for each quadrat was estimated with a Huggins 4-pass mark-resight population estimator, but with initial capture and resighting probabilities modeled in common across all sample quadrats. Pooling mark-resight data across quadrats was necessary because few owls were marked on individual quadrats to estimate quadrat-specific capture probabilities. Model-based estimates of owl abundance for each quadrat necessitated variance estimation procedures that take into account correlated quadrat estimates. An auxiliary variable relating to topographic roughness of sampled quadrats provided a useful covariate for a ratio estimator.},

     abstract = {Aerial surveys of wildlife populations must correct for failure to observe all animals to obtain unbiased population estimates. We captured and radiocollared elk (Cervus elaphus) in northcentral Pennsylvania to develop a linear-logistic model of characteristics of elk groups associated with visibility bias during helicopter surveys. We used this sightability model in a Horvitz-Thompson sightability-adjustment population estimator. The number of elk in a group was positively correlated (P < 0.001), and the percent canopy cover was negatively correlated (P = 0.002) with the probability of observing a group of elk. Observations of elk groups of known size indicated that helicopter crews undercounted elk group sizes, and percentage of elk missed increased as percent canopy cover increased. Probably because of this undercounting, 3 of 6 population estimates from the sightability-adjustment estimator were less than the number of elk known to be alive on the study area. Simulations of elk surveys using our empirical data indicated that our population estimates may have been negatively biased by 20%, because of undercounting. The assumption of complete enumeration of sighted groups of animals should be verified when using this estimator. When all assumptions of the estimator were met during computer simulations, confidence intervals calculated under the assumption of asymptotic normality and log-normality did not provide nominal coverage. We found that a sightability model using only group size as an independent variable, even when the true sightability model also included percent canopy cover, provided population estimates with little negative bias (<1%), shorter confidence intervals, and the lowest mean square error (MSE). Further research is needed on selection of sightability models, and we recommend using a bootstrap technique to calculate confidence intervals. We believe the sightability-adjustment estimator is unsuitable for estimating population size for small populations (?1,000 animals).},

     abstract = {We studied population subdivision and density-dependent and independent factors influencing population processes between 1965 and 2001 for elk (Cervus elaphus) inhabiting Rocky Mountain National Park (park) and the adjacent Estes Valley (town), Colorado, USA. Elk numbers within the park were held relatively constant by management controls until 1967, after which time they were allowed to increase without human interference. Radiotelemetry of 73 elk indicated limited exchange between the subpopulations; combined with clear distinctions in population dynamics, this suggests that these subpopulations are relatively independent despite the absence of physical barriers between them. The elk subpopulation within the park initially increased at 6.5%/year between 1968 and 1970, then growth gradually slowed-exhibiting density-dependent reductions both in calf survival and recruitment with increasing population size-and approached an estimated carrying capacity of 1,069 ? 55 (x? ? SE). Since 1991, this subpopulation has remained within ?5% of this equilibrium. The adjacent Estes Valley subpopulation grew at an estimated maximum 5-year average rate of 11.0% from 1979 to 1983 and is still increasing at 5.2%/year (1991-2001 average). Estimated town population currently is about 70% of our projected carrying capacity of 2,869 ? 415 elk based on projection of observed calf recruitment decline with increasing population. Both carrying-capacity estimates are consistent with independent estimates based on forage biomass and energy considerations. Adult cow survival rate was not found to differ between park and town, and we estimated a constant rate of 0.913 [95% CI = 0.911, 0.915]. Bull survival rates increased in the park from 0.52 to 0.79 between 1965 and 2001, but remained constant at 0.42 [0.35, 0.47] in the Estes Valley. Colder winter temperatures were correlated with reduced calf recruitment (calves:cow at age 0.5 yr) and with reduced calf survival (between age 0.5 and 1.5 yr) in town. Recruitment of town elk also increased with warmer summer temperatures and greater summer precipitation. No weather covariates were significantly correlated with calf recruitment or survival in the park. Declining calf recruitment has been nearly linear and similar in both the park and town. In the park, calf survival responded little to density when the population was well below carrying capacity, but responded at an increasing rate as the population neared carrying capacity. This pattern may explain why calf survival response to density has not yet been detected in town. We estimated current combined population size of 3,049 [2759, 3369] elk in 2001. Elk in the town sector currently out-number elk in the adjacent national park by almost 2:1 and are projected to increase by 46% before being nutritionally limited, suggesting that human-elk conflicts likely will increase in the absence of active management intervention.},

     abstract = {Most Dall's sheep (Ovis dalli dalli) population-monitoring efforts use intensive aerial surveys with no attempt to estimate variance or adjust for potential sightability bias. We used radiocollared sheep to assess factors that could affect sightability of Dall's sheep in standard fixed-wing and helicopter surveys and to evaluate feasibility of methods that might account for sightability bias. Work was conducted in conjunction with annual aerial surveys of Dall's sheep in the western Baird Mountains, Alaska, USA, in 2000-2003. Overall sightability was relatively high compared with other aerial wildlife surveys, with 88% of the available, marked sheep detected in our fixed-wing surveys. Total counts from helicopter surveys were not consistently larger than counts from fixed-wing surveys of the same units, and detection probabilities did not differ for the 2 aircraft types. Our results suggest that total counts from helicopter surveys cannot be used to obtain reliable estimates of detection probabilities for fixed-wing surveys. Groups containing radiocollared sheep often changed in size and composition before they could be observed by a second crew in units that were double-surveyed. Double-observer methods that require determination of which groups were detected by each observer will be infeasible unless survey procedures can be modified so that groups remain more stable between observations. Mean group sizes increased during our study period, and our logistic regression sightability model indicated that detection probabilities increased with group size. Mark-resight estimates of annual population sizes were similar to sightability-model estimates, and confidence intervals overlapped broadly. We recommend the sightability-model approach as the most effective and feasible of the alternatives we considered for monitoring Dall's sheep populations.},
